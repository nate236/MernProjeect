# Description
Modern websites are driven by two key factors: data and user demands. Personalizing user data is fundamental to real-world web development, and as user expectations evolve, applications must become more performant.

This week, I worked on refactoring a Google Books API search engine that was originally built with a RESTful API. Using Apollo Server, I transformed the application into a GraphQL API to enhance efficiency and flexibility in data retrieval.
